# Vegescope ðŸŒ±

## Our project for Purdue University's 2023 Hello World Hackathon

## Inspiration
We were inspired by our many friends with diverse dietary restrictions. Our group includes members with vegetarian and lactose-free diets, so we wanted to create a project to help people like them.

## What it does
This app takes the users dietary preference (vegan or vegetarian) and retrieves location and then outputs resturant recommendations that accommodate their needs. It also includes a recipe blog and brand recommendation page, as well as a form that sends the user's name and email to a spreadsheet so that the developers can view feedback and questions.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a website through Visual Studio Code, and uploaded our files to Github. We also used the Google Maps API to find the user's location and map local restaurants, as well as Google Sheets Apps Script to receive feedback. Some designs were made in Procreate.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble using Javascript to connect to the Google Maps API, but we were ultimately able to link several buttons on the homepage to the maps.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of our final design, as the section borders were hand-drawn and the maps were fully integrated into the website.

## What's next for Vegescope
In future iterations, we hope to add a greater variety of diets to consider all potential users. These include options for restaurants with gluten-free, lactose-free, and other diverse dietary needs.
